    "- I really enjoyed the time spent with my team, truly a great team. I believe it is a positive when your team are people you can get along with because the team members are more likely to share ideas, which may improve the project. \n",
    "- Things I have learned:\n",
    "    - Most memorable thing I have learned are ArrayLists or Paaras says Airray. I find this to be avery useful tool for storing data. Since an ArrayList is able to modify the things inside of the ArrayList, it has an advantage over arrays, which are unable to be changed. \n",
    "    - I have also learned about inheritance. This is an important piece of learning because it helps you organize the classes by the super classes and subclasses. This lets you make a super class of general information and the sub class to be much more specific. This is very good because it is neater.\n",
    "- What I hope to learn:\n",
    "    - I hope to learn how to use vectors. The reason I would like to learn vectors is because I heard my brother using it and I tried researching it on my own and I couldn't really find the benefits of using vectors over ArrayLists. So that is why I would like to learn about vectors in Java."
