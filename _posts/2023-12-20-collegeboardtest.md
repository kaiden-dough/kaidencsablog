On this college board test, the score that I got was a 35/39. AYY AYY. That I believe is a terrific score and I think that would be a 5 on the CSA test, excluding the code part.
### Corrections:
- Q3: ![image](https://github.com/CSA-Tri-2/JDK-miniproject/assets/69410126/494a8827-afff-48ca-b65b-9674e57f9587)
    - Huh, I don't know why this one is wrong, I recall choosing answer B, but I guess my click missed????
- Q9: ![image](https://github.com/CSA-Tri-2/JDK-miniproject/assets/69410126/219c16cc-3be7-4bab-b27d-2dd3ea5977ba)
    - So the math random thing + math random gives numbers from 0-10, but we want 2-12 so I just needed to add 2, this one I don't think I would have gotten no matter what.
- Q22: ![image](https://github.com/CSA-Tri-2/JDK-miniproject/assets/69410126/a46146b6-4d07-4b88-8522-08108c6625f4)
    - I got this wrong because I just thought of the question wrong, as you can see by my time, I was rushing and just didn't think it through.
- Q26: ![image](https://github.com/CSA-Tri-2/JDK-miniproject/assets/69410126/4f838a79-589d-4243-ba49-1050915b2c41)
    - I got this wrong because I am a fool. I was careless and I did not notice that the variables were only in the scope of each method so they did not modify each other.
### Concerning Times
I realize that my times on the last few questions are very short. To explain this phenomenon, my parents decided I had been on my computer for too long and decided to shut off my wifi. So I had already opened all the problems, but it just wasn't submitting, so I used a hotspot to input my answers and submit the test.
### Journey, Learnings, Discovery
Through this mcq test I have learned many things about myself and the curriculum. I realized that I have trouble staying focused because this test was very draining because I had to think about all the possibilities. Also, I learned I should probably write my thinking down to help from being too jumbled in my head as I realized this throughout the test. Regarding the content, I have trouble understanding the extending concepts. Also, I keep on mixing up the 2D array [][] thing, but I know that it is columns first then rows or bigger groups then the things inside of it. So overall, I need to be more organized and focused while doing these tests. I should make sure to write down what I am thinking to not get confused and stay focused to meet the time requirements.
